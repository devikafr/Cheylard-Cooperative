This is a project done on PHP.
The learning purpose is to create a website to sell community products.
  - create connections on mysql
  - do update, delete, insert etc.
  - e-commerce (yet to be added).
  
 Anyone interested in learning PHP welcome to use my code.
 
 Thanks to SimplonVE and Stephen Montet to teaching me.
